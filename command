Invoking Commands in Magic
   1] Mouse Buttons:
Common commands are mapped to mouse buttons for quick access.
Example: Use the middle mouse button to paint an area red or erase it.


  2] Key Macros:
Single keystrokes perform predefined actions.
Example: Pressing g toggles the grid display.

 3]Long Commands:
Type commands into the console window for more complex actions.
Triggered by pressing : (colon) or ; (semicolon) in the layout window.
Example: Typing paint red fills the selected box with red color.

Layout Window vs. Console Window:
Layout Window: Interprets single keystrokes as macros.
Console Window: Interprets full commands. Keyboard focus can be switched between these windows using the long command macro.

Keyboard Focus Models:
Click to Focus: Click on a window to give it keyboard focus.
Focus on Enter: Window gains focus when the mouse cursor enters it.

Practical Usage Tips
Mouse Commands: Utilize mouse button bindings for quick tasks like painting or erasing. For instance, holding Shift while using the middle mouse button always erases the content within the box.

Macros: Use single keystrokes for commonly used functions to save time. For example, use g to toggle the grid without typing out the full command.

Long Commands: When needing more specific control or performing less frequent tasks, switch to long commands. Use : or ; to access the console window and type commands like paint red to modify your layout.

Focus Switching: Be mindful of keyboard focus to avoid inefficiencies. For instance, use the long command macro to seamlessly switch focus to the console window when typing long commands.

Defining New Macros: As you become more familiar with Magic, consider creating custom macros for frequently used commands to streamline your workflow.

Exiting Magic: Use the quit command to exit. If you encounter issues where the quit command is not recognized, use Tclâ€™s exit command as a fallback.

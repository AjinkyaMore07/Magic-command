Magic Tutorial #3: Advanced Painting (Wiring and Plowing)

This tutorial introduces advanced features in Magic for managing layouts, focusing on wiring and plowing techniques.
1. Introduction

In the previous tutorials, you learned basic painting and selection techniques. This tutorial will cover more advanced features that enhance efficiency when dealing with complex layouts.
2. Wiring

Wiring allows you to quickly draw wires by specifying start and end points, rather than using the box tool.

Key Commands:

    :tool
        Action: Switches between different tools. The space bar is a macro for this command.
        Usage: Use :tool info to get details about the current tool and mouse button functions.

    Basic Wiring Commands:
        :wire [direction]
            Usage: Paints wire segments. Default is horizontal or vertical, but you can specify direction with options like horizontal or vertical.
        :wire horizontal or :wire vertical
            Usage: Forces the direction of the wire leg.

Steps:

    Select Wiring Material: Point to a piece of material and left-click to select it.
    Add Legs:
        Right-click to draw a wire segment from the current box position to the cursor.
        Continue adding segments by right-clicking at new positions.
    Place Contacts: Middle-click to place a contact, which also updates the material type and thickness to match the layer of the contact.

Example:

    Draw a red wire from label 1 to label 2, then to labels 3 and 4. Repeat with blue material for different segments.

Special Features:

    Box Positioning: Use the box tool to set starting points for wires if the desired material isnâ€™t available under the cursor.
    Selection Commands: New wire legs and contacts are automatically selected, making them easy to modify with commands like :stretch.

3. Tools

Understanding Tools:

    Box Tool: Default tool for creating and modifying boxes.
    Wiring Tool: Used for placing and manipulating wires.
    Netlist Tool: For netlist editing (covered in Tutorial #7).

Switching Tools:

    Command: :tool
    Macro: Space bar ( ) cycles through tools.

Command Example:

    Switch to the wiring tool and use :tool info to view current tool details and mouse button functions.

4. Basic Wiring Commands

Material Selection:

    Left-click on a piece of material to select its type and width.

Drawing Wires:

    Right-click to draw wire segments. Magic auto-aligns to horizontal or vertical directions, but you can force directions with :wire horizontal or :wire vertical.

5. Contacts

Placing Contacts:

    Middle-click to place a contact at the end of the wire leg. This updates the material type and thickness to match the layer of the contact.

Error Handling:

    If contacts cannot be placed between certain layers, Magic will issue an error message.

6. Wiring and the Box

Using the Box:

    The box helps start new wires in areas without the desired material. Use the box tool to reposition the starting point for wire legs.

Material Selection Without a Box:

    Use :wire type layer width to specify wire material and width directly.

7. Wiring and Selection

Adjusting Wires:

    Use :stretch to adjust the position of wire legs and contacts after they have been drawn.

Example:

    Paint a blue wire segment and use :stretch to adjust its length and position.

8. Bundles of Wires

Commands for Bundles:

    :fill direction [layers]
        Extends paint in the specified direction.
    :corner direction1 direction2 [layers]
        Creates L-shaped wires.

Example Usage:

    Use :fill left or :corner right up to extend or create L-shaped wire bundles.

Replicating Contacts:

    Use :array xsize ysize to replicate a contact across a bundle of wires.

Example Command:

    :array 1 10 copies a selected contact 10 times in the y-direction.

9. Plowing

Plowing Basics:

    Command: :plow direction [layers]
        Usage: Moves material in a specified direction, preserving design rules and connectivity.

Examples:

    :plow up moves material from the bottom to the top of the box.
    :plow right metal1 moves metal1 edges to the right.

Plowing Options:

    :plow nojogs and :plow jogs control jog insertion during plowing.
    :plow straighten and :plow nostraighten control jog straightening after plowing.

Boundary Control:

    :plow boundary restricts plowing to a specified area, preserving the geometry outside the boundary.

Example Usage:

    Place the box over an area, use :plow boundary, and then plow within the boundary.
